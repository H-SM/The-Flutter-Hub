## What is a Developer Account and what is used for ? 
The last step in creating an application is to make it available to the target audience, which means putting it on Google Play and the App Store. To ensure that the customer retains the rights to manage assemblies, the application must be posted through a special developer account.

A developer account is an account on Google Play or the App Store that can be used to publish a mobile app and receive statistical data regarding how it is used.

A standard user account only lets you download apps, books, movies, and other content. It is not used for publishing programs. Creating a developer account means that you will be able to publish an app for consumption by a wider audience, receive feedback, and promote the product.

A developer page contains information about the brand and applications that have been published under it. Google Play requires the following information:
- The name of the developer
- A physical address
- Advertising text
- A logo and cover

When adding an app to the App Store, you will need to enter:
- A name
- A subheading
- URL
- App language and category
- The price and countries where the app will be available
- Whether you app has “In-App Purchases”
- The app version
- Screenshots and videos
- Advertising copy, keywords, and a description
- Contact information and footnotes

`Overall, it gives more resources in-order to deploy & test applications to the respective app stores - by getting the required identifier for the application ( as of a domain name and application id (hosting id) for a web project), this identifier connects the applicatoin to the backend and also stable deployment of these application in the respective stores`

### 2 Types 
- Individual - you are liable (you are the spot light, any issue in the application is your doing)
- Company - company are liable (based on what you have made)
