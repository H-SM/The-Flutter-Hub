## Android App Setup 
### this will cover how to connect our andriod phone to the codebase and see the live result
- for this we install -> '[scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)'
- this will mirror my andriod screen on desktop (this is much faster) 
- before this, need need to install `ADB(Android Debug Bridge)` -> send command from terminal to my device (my phone over where we have deployed the project) 

we download ADB by -> 
```bash
brew install --cask android-platform-tools
```
