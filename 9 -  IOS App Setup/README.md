## IOS App Setup 
### this will cover App indentifier, profile, Certificates 
(we need an ios developer account ( 99 dollars)) -> `App store connect`

## what Profile and certificates are needed?
- application needs to be certificated and shipped to apple store by Apple (this is like a indentifier for the application)
- Profiles are app indentifier ( this is the indentity of the developer, whereas certificate is the indentity of the application)
- application should have a signed `production ceritificate` and also a `preoduction profile` to which the applicationa nd the certificate is hooked onto

(We can make a developer account (with the money :))
To summarize we need `certificates,Profiles, app ID with device indentifiers`.
