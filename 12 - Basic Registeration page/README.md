## Making Basic Regsitersation Page 
We will create up a Basic Registeration Page for the user to login to and access their data after the checkng if their credentials. This floater application contacts with the Firebase and gets the user's info over it. 

### So let's start up (this is the basic workflow over this chapter) -> 
- Removing comments from main.dart
- we can do a hot reload by -> `ctrl + S` (just basic stuff)
- If changes are heavily drastic and BIG then -> hot Restart the application is the option (we can do this from the drat's menu)
- State & stateful(state is the state of the application & stateful are the widgets/components under the effect of this state[or any]) functions and attributes. 
- we can even have stateless widgets/functions which are nearly alike default functions (immumatable variables are here [not having a state])
- -> `stl`-> emmet for a stateful widget/compo 
- `Scaffold` -> we need this widget for the HomePage/component to interact with Android and reach to favourable results (eg -> if we need the navbar/notification bar for the page to be dark, scaffold allows us to traverse with our application)
